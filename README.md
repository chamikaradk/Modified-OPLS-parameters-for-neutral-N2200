# Modified-OPLS-parameters-for-N2200
OPLS parameters for N2200 polymer are provided. Charges and dihedrals potentials are explicitly calculated using DFT OT-w-HPBE 6-31G** level, and using charge model 5 (CM5). Crystal polymorphic models of N2200/P(NDI2OD-T2) are elucidated using a combination of periodic DFT and classical molecular dynamics.
